# Zabbix API PHP Client with session caching and SSL support

There are quite a lot of Zabbix API clients out that work really well with [Zabbix](https://www.zabbix.com). However most of them do not support `session caching` or need tweaks to work with self signed certificates.

This library aims to solve those problems. It supports the following features:

* Session caching.
* HTTPS connections with official- and self-signed certificates.
* Works with Linux and Windows PHP implementations.
* Multiple concurrent connections with different user accounts and/or different servers.
* Zabbix versions: 3.0, 3.2, 3.4, 4.0, 4.2, 4.4, 5.0 and 5.2.
* No installation required.

It is commercially backed up and maintained by [IntelliTrend GmbH](https://www.intellitrend.de), an official Zabbix Partner and Zabbix Training company.

There was also a lightning talk [Zabbix API â€“ the easy way](https://blog.zabbix.com/zabbix-api-the-easy-way/11748/) about using this library on the Zabbix conference 2020 in Benelux.

## Why Session caching?

### How authentication via API usally works

Each time an application uses `user.login`, the Zabbix API creates a so called `AuthKey`. (See [user.login](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/5.0/manual/api/reference/user/login)). This key is then passed via each request through the `auth` request property.

In most cases, the API libary does this transparently for the user. However, if the script is called later on again (i.e by a cron job), a new `user.login` is performed, thus creating a new `AuthKey` for that new session.

Zabbix keeps those session, until a session expired or is logged out. You can check your actual settings through the Zabbix frontend: `Administration/General/Housekeeper - Section Sessions`. The default value is 365days.

This means, any created session (if there is no logout) will be kept for 365 days.

Assume we have a set of 10 API scripts that run every hour. This means we will create `10 x 24 = 240` sessions per day. Using more scripts or a smaller interval will of cause increase this number.

### The problem with many sessions in the session table

Everytime a request hits the Zabbix frontend, either per webbrowser or as a JSON RPC API request, Zabbix has to verify the request against the existing sessions. The more sessions to verify, the longer this will take.

Note: We have seen installations with millions of sessions, where frontend access slowed down considerable by 15sec+ per request.  Keep in mind that for example the dashboard not only performs one request, but multiple requests depending on the number of widgets used.

So the best is to `reuse` a session, until it expires. This is where session caching steps in.

## Using session caching with the Zabbix API

When a new session is created, the AuthKey is saved encrypted to disk. This is similar to using a cookie in a classic webbrowser. If a new request is performed, the existing session is read once and the AuthKey is reused.

So to follow up the example given before: Calling a script using session-caching, even over a month, will create just `1` session.

If the AuthKey becomes invalid, the libary automatically performs a new `user.login`, re-executes the failed request and updates the stored session. All of this happens in the background, the user of the libary has not to deal with it.


### How does session encryption work, what about multiple sessions?

Each session has a unique name based on a hash using the `zabbixUserName` and the `zabbixUrl`.
The session itself is encrypted using the `zabbixUserName` and the `zabbixPassword`.

This way, the libary can be used with different useraccounts and also different zabbix server instances.

### Where are sessions stored?

Sessions are stored by default in the users `tmp` directory. However there is a config option `sessionDir` that allows to override this setting. See the detailed description below.

# Installation

There is no installation required. Simply copy the file `ZabbixApi.php` and use the class.

Note: The PHP environment **must have CURL** installed. `ZabbixApi.php` has a built-in check for curl and will throw an exception if curl is missing.

```php
require_once "ZabbixApi.php";
$zbx = new Zabbixapi();
```


# Usage

## Error handling

The library makes use of `Exceptions`. There is no need to check each response value. Simply wrap the calls in `try/catch blocks`.

Depending on where an error occurs, different error codes are passed to the exception object, together with the message property.

* `Zabbix API errors`: The original API error code and message is passed.
* `Connection and SSL errors`: The original CURL error code and message is passed.
* `Library errors`: A constant error code, as defined in the class constant EXCEPTION_CLASS_CODE, and a useful message is passed. Default=1000.

## Configuration

The class is configured when calling the `login` method. Any further Zabbix API call is performed by the `call` method.

Note: One can run multiple instances at the same time, connecting with different user accounts to the same zabbix server or to another zabbix server.

## Basic usage

Lets start with a very simple example:

```php
require_once "ZabbixApi.php";
$zbx = new ZabbixApi();
try {
	$zbx->login('https://my.zabbixurl.com/zabbix', 'myusername', 'mypassword');
	$result = $zbx->call('host.get', array("countOutput" => true));
	print "Number of hosts:$result\n";
} catch (Exception $e) {
	print "==== Exception ===\n";
	print 'Errorcode: '.$e->getCode()."\n";
	print 'ErrorMessage: '.$e->getMessage()."\n";
	exit;
}
```

Basically this is all needed. The `call` method is transparent to the Zabbix API definition. It takes 2 parameter: `$method` and `$params` as specified for the particular Zabbix API method.

For example to retrieve all 'Host Groups' with all properties, we can do this:

```php
require_once "ZabbixApi.php";
$zbx = new ZabbixApi();
$zabUrl = 'https://my.zabbixurl.com/zabbix';
$zabUser = 'myusername';
$zabPassword = 'mypassword';
try {
	$zbx->login($zabUrl, $zabUser, $zabPassword);
	$result = $zbx->call('hostgroup.get', array("output" => 'extend'));
	foreach ($result as $hostGroup) {
		$hostGroupId = $hostGroup['groupid'];
		$hostGroupName = $hostGroup['name'];
		print "groupid:$hostGroupId, hostGroupName:$hostGroupName\n";
	}
} catch (Exception $e) {
	print "==== Exception ===\n";
	print 'Errorcode: '.$e->getCode()."\n";
	print 'ErrorMessage: '.$e->getMessage()."\n";
	exit;
}
```
Note: This second example would not create a new session when calling `login` again after the first example. It would reuse the session from the previous example. `login` returns true when an existing session was found.

## Advanced usage and SSL Options

The basic example works fine, even with HTTPS, given there is a valid certificate the php installation is aware of. But what todo when using self-signed certificates?

Here we can use the optional `options` argument when calling `login` to setup the SSL options.

Example - Turn off SSL verification:

```php
require_once "ZabbixApi.php";
$zbx = new ZabbixApi();
$options = array('sslVerifyPeer' => false, 'sslVerifyHost' => false);
try {
	$zbx->login('https://my.zabbixurl.com/zabbix', 'myusername', 'mypassword', $options);
	$result = $zbx->call('host.get', array("countOutput" => true));
	print "Number of hosts:$result\n";
} catch (Exception $e) {
	print "==== Exception ===\n";
	print 'Errorcode: '.$e->getCode()."\n";
	print 'ErrorMessage: '.$e->getMessage()."\n";
	exit;
}
```


## Using filters and field selectors

It is quite easy to pass filter and field selectors through the API. Basically any params defined by the Zabbix-API can be passed this way.

Example - Select first 5 hosts filtered by status, maintenance_status and type and add their groups and macros.

```php
$zbx = new ZabbixApi();
try {
	// default is to verify certificate and hostname
	$options = array('sslVerifyPeer' => false, 'sslVerifyHost' => false);
	$zbx->login('https://my.zabbixurl.com/zabbix', 'myusername', 'mypassword', $options);

	print "====================================================================\n";
	// Get hosts and other information available to this useraccount, but filtered and limited
	$limit = 5;
	$params = array(
		'output' => array('hostid', 'host', 'name', 'status', 'maintenance_status', 'description'),
		'filter' => array('status' => 0, 'maintenance_status' => 0, 'type' => 1),
		'selectGroups' => array('groupid', 'name'),
		'selectInterfaces' => array('interfaceid', 'main', 'type', 'useip', 'ip', 'dns', 'port'),
		'selectInventory' => array('os', 'contact', 'location'),
		'selectMacros' => array('macro', 'value'),
		'limit' => $limit
	);

	$result = $zbx->call('host.get',$params);
	print "==== Filtered hostlist with groups and macros ====\n";
	foreach($result as $host) {
		printf("HostId:%d - Host:%s\n", $host['hostid'], $host['host']);
		foreach($host['groups'] as $group) {
			printf("    - GroupId:%d - Group:%s\n", $group['groupid'], $group['name']);
		}
		foreach($host['macros'] as $macro) {
			printf("    - Macro:%s - Value:%s\n", $macro['macro'], $macro['value']);
		}

	}

} catch (Exception $e) {
	print "==== Exception ===\n";
	print 'Errorcode: '.$e->getCode()."\n";
	print 'ErrorMessage: '.$e->getMessage()."\n";
	exit;
}
```
## Debug Mode

The class provides a debug mode that ouputs a lot of details. To enable, either use an option or function.

Debug Option as param in login():

```php
$zbx = new ZabbixApi();
try {
	$options = array('sslVerifyPeer' => false, 'sslVerifyHost' => false, 'debug' => true);
	$zbx->login('https://my.zabbixurl.com/zabbix', 'myusername', 'mypassword', $options);
	...
```
Debug Function - can be used any time:

```php
# Turn debug on
$zbx = new ZabbixApi();
$zbx->setDebug(true);
try {
	$options = array('sslVerifyPeer' => false, 'sslVerifyHost' => false);
	$zbx->login('https://my.zabbixurl.com/zabbix', 'myusername', 'mypassword', $options);
	...
	# Can be turned off anytime
	$zbx->setDebug(false);
	...
	# And turned on again
	$zbx->setDebug(true);
```

# Functions reference

## Basic functions

### login($zabUrl, $zabUser, $zabPassword, $options)

Initial login. Configures the class and loads a cached session if it exists. It does not executes a request to the remote server to test the credentials or session at this time. This happens automatically during the first call to the Zabbix-API. One can enforce the validation by calling `getAuthKey()` after `login()`. Note: If debug is enabled via option, or via function before calling `login()`, `login()` issues a call to the Zabbix-API to check wether the session is re-used.

* `return` void
* `throws` Exception $e. Invalid options, session issues or connection problems.
* `param` string $zabUrl
* `param` string $zabUser
* `param` string $zabPassword
* `param` array $options - optional settings.
Example: `array('sslVerifyPeer' => false, 'sslVerifyHost' => false);`
  * `debug`: boolean - default=false. Show debug information. Also setDebug() can be used. Default is false
  * `sessionDir`: string - default=user `tmp` directory. Directory where to store the sessions.
  * `sslCaFile`: string - default=use php.ini settings. Filename of external CACertBundle. Useful when using self signed certificates from internal CA. See the CURL or Mozilla websites for those bundles.
  * `sslVerifyPeer`: boolean - default=true. Verify certificate. Throws Exception on failure. When false, ignore any verfication errors.
  * `sslVerifyHost`: boolean - default=true. Verify Hostname against CN in  certificate. Only works if certificate can be validated. Note: If sslVerifyPeer=false but the certificate itself is valid and the hostname does not match, then sslVerifyHost=true will raise an exception.
  * `useGzip`: boolean - default=true. Use gzip compression for requests.
  * `connectTimeout`: integer - default=10. Max. time in seconds to connect to server.
  * `timeout`: default=30. Max. time in seconds to process request.

### call($method, $params)

Execute Zabbix API call. Will automatically login/re-login and retry if the call failed using the current authKey read from session.

Note: Can only be called after login() was called once before at any time.

* `return` mixed $reusedSession. Decoded Json response from API call or a scalar. See Zabbix API documentation for details.
* `throws` Exception $e. API Error, Session issues or connection problems.
* `param` string $method. Zabbix API method i.e. 'host.get'
* `param` mixed $params. Params as defined in the Zabbix API for that particular method.

### logout()

Logout from Zabbix Server and also delete the authKey from filesystem.

Only use this method if its really needed, because you cannot reuse the session later on.

* `return` void
* `throws` Exception $e. API Error, Session issues or connection problems

### setDebug($state)

Enable / Disable debug output. Can be used any time.

* `return` void
* `param` boolean $state. True enables debug output.

## Convenient functions

### getVersion()

Get version of this library.

* `return` string $version.

### getApiVersion()

Get Zabbix API version from Zabbix Server.

* `return` string $version. Uses API method 'apiinfo.version'.
* `throws` Exception $e. API Error, Session issues or connection problems

## Utility functions

### getAuthKey()

Get authKey used for API communication. Note: If there was no previous call to the Zabbix-API, this funcion will call the Zabbix-API to ensure a valid key.
* `return` string $authKey.

### getSessionDir()

Get session directory.

* `return` string $directory.

### getSessionFileName()

Get session FileName storing the encrypted authKey without path.

* `return` string $fileName.

### getSessionFile()

Get full FileName with path.

* `return` string $fileName.

# Tips and Tricks

## Common "get" method parameters

As described in the [Zabbix-API](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/manual/api/reference_commentary), there several parameter that can be added to a "get" method.

Find attached a list of some less known but quite useful ones, especially `preservekeys` :

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :-------- | :--- | :---------- |
| countOutput | boolean | Return the number of records in the result instead of the actual data. |
| editable | boolean | If set to true return only objects that the user has write permissions to. Default: false. |
| limit | integer | Limit the number of records returned. |
| preservekeys | boolean | Use IDs as keys in the resulting array. |
